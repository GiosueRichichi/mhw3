                    <h1>As It Was</h1>
                    <p>“As It Was” swerves into Eighties-style synth-pop, in the vein of A-Ha or Depeche Mode. The synth hook sounds like warped steel drums, with tolling chimes at the
                         end — Styles is credited with playing “tubular bells.” His vocals are bittersweet, almost piercingly poignant, with the intimate vibe of a journal entry

                    <h1>Glass Animals</h1>
                    <p>“I wanted this album to be a full reflection of life,” Glass Animals’ frontman Dave Bayley explained of their third album ‘Dreamland’ in
                         their recent NME cover feature. Having created two albums that largely explored the lives of others
                         (2014 debut ‘Zaba’ and its follow 2016 follow-up ‘How to Be a Human Being’, 
                         the latter of which based each of the 11 songs on a different character), their latest 
                         release marks a stark change in how the Oxfordian quartet construct an album. For the first time the work is entirely autobiographical.
                         In the past Bayley had been afraid to write about himself (“I always thought it was selfish,” he told us), but on the deeply moving final track 
                         of ‘How to Be a Human Being’, ‘Agnes’, Bayley opened up about a friend he lost to suicide. ‘Agnes’ quickly became a fan favourite, and this reaction, 
                         as well as Bayley’s experiences working with other artists who wrote about themselves (such as Joey Bada$$ and Khalid), opened him up to the possibilities of writing autobiographically.

                    <h1>Industry Baby</h1>
                    <p>
                         After blowing the world away with his otherworldly style all-around, Lil Nas X has returned for another shocker of a music video. 
                         The single, titled “INDUSTRY BABY,” features rapper Jack Harlow and is all about exceeding what others expected from you.
                         While snippets of the song have been circling for months, the video was an entire experience in itself. 
                         The announcement of the song’s release date came after Lil Nas X had been talking about being nervous before having to go to court for a Nike lawsuit Monday, 
                         July 19. Fortunately, it seemed to just be a promotion for the new song as a precursor to the actual video was released that day, 
                         playing on the lawsuit, ending in the rapper getting sentenced to five years in the fictional “Montero State Prison.”  
                         The single and official music video following the story was then put out Friday, July 23, taking place inside the prison, showcasing the rapper’s time there. 
                         Lil Nas starts the track by listing his accomplishments and referring to the fact that many critics dismissed him as a “one-hit wonder.” But, to some people's surprise,
                         he has dropped many other chart-topping singles since “Old Town Road” and is here to stay.

                    <h1>Mercury - Acts 1 & 2</h1>
                    <p>Hearing that Mercury - Act 2 would be sonically different from their previous outputs and influenced by hip-hop, I was curious and even intrigued. 
                         Imagine Dragons was a band in desperate need of a shake-up in sound,
                         as they have been chasing the most milquetoast and commercial pop-rock you could possibly imagine, for years. A change in sound seemed good, it sounded like a step forward.
                         Most of the songs here are the ones you would expect from Imagine Dragons by now — generic and overblown, with production that attempts and largely fails at 
                         adding the bite that is severely lacking from the lyrics and vocal performance. 'Blur', 'I'm Happy', 'Peace Of Mind', 'Higher Ground', 'Younger' — they all have 
                         epic-sounding choruses, but it all amounts to nothing. It feels empty and hollow, like injecting an extra dose or two of artificial drama into the production, 
                         instead of coming up with a clever instrumentation or a thought-provoking line. That's why tracks like 'Ferris Wheel', 'I Don't Like Myself', 'Waves' and 'Symphony' 
                         are plain unmemorable. And how could they not? Mercury - Act 2 is 18 tracks and almost an hour long of the same, plain formula; all the songs just blend together, 
                         slip into one ear and out the other and by the point something even remotely arresting happens, your interest will have evaporated. This album is a slog to go through.

                    <h1>I Love You</h1>
                    <p>
                         Blending ambient, emo sound with upbeat, quirky pop, The Neighbourhood’s debut album, I Love You., presents the band’s 
                         alternative sound to the indie rock scene. It’s hard to compare The Neighbourhood, as they borrow moody and dark sounds from bands like Placebo,
                         progressive and theatrical from Muse, fun and positive from Vampire Weekend, and chill from The Postal Service. Their sounds combine to create a rare 
                         blend of rock, along the way offering ambient, pop, and even hip hop mixes and infusing themes of both being carefree and fearful.
                         Opening like a dark, suspenseful movie, I Love You.’s first few songs are progressive and slow. The first, “How,” is ambient and spacey, taking its time as moves
                         through electronic sounds. The lyrics tell a story, conveying feelings of bitterness and anger. The next song, “Afraid” is similarly progressive and chill, but 
                         uses more beat and is livelier. The song conveys fear, singing over and over again “when I wake up, I’m afraid; somebody else might take my place.” “Afraid” also
                         hints at pop and hip hop beats, which are more prominent as we move through the album.</p>
